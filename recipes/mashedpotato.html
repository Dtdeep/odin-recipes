        <h1>Chef John's Perfect Mashed Potatoes</h1>
        
        <p>
                Chef John’s Perfect Mashed Potatoes are known for their ultra-smooth, creamy texture and rich, buttery flavor. He starts by simmering Yukon Gold potatoes until tender, then dries them briefly to remove excess moisture. The potatoes are passed through a ricer for a light, lump-free consistency, and slowly mixed with hot milk, butter, and seasoning to create a silky mash that’s both simple and luxurious.
