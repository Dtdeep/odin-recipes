            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>
                This sweet potato casserole with marshmallows toes the line 
                between side dish and dessert — and we wouldn't have it any other way. 
                Pureed sweet potatoes are blended with sugar and spices, then topped with 
                marshmallows and baked to sweet, gooey perfection.
            </p>
            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                    <li>Sweet Potatoes: You'll need about five sweet potatoes, peeled and sliced.</li>
                    <li>Brown Sugar: Brown sugar is essential to the cozy, toasty, warmth we're after when we make sweet potato casserole. Use light for a milder flavor or dark for a more intense flavor.</li>
                    <li>Butter: Use real butter for the best flavor and creamy texture. Margarine can be used if that's what you have on hand.</li>
                    <li>Orange Juice: Three tablespoons of orange juice gives this sweet potato casserole subtle brightness.</li>
                    <li>Cinnamon: Just a pinch of cinnamon adds warmth and brings out the other flavors.</li>
                    <li>Marshmallows: Of course, you'll need a bag of miniature marshmallows (they'll be the star of the show, after all).</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                    <li>
                            Cook and mash the sweet potatoes: Place the peeled and cubed sweet potatoes in a saucepan and cover with water. Cook over medium-high heat until tender, then drain and mash with a potato masher.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Mix and top the casserole: Use an electric mixer to mix the mashed (and cooled) sweet potatoes, brown sugar, margarine, cinnamon, and orange juice. Pour the mixture into a baking dish. Top with marshmallows.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                            Bake the casserole: Bake in a preheated oven until the marshmallows are puffed and lightly browned, about half an hour.
                    </li>
            </ol>
